# Branching Strategy Summary

### 1. [Git Flow](./Git_Flow.md)
- Best For: Large, complex projects with scheduled releases and multiple contributors.
- Why: It provides a structured approach, separating development, release, and production. This suits organizations where release cycles are planned and controlled.
- Limitations: It can be cumbersome for rapid deployment cycles due to its complexity and branch maintenance.
### 2. [GitHub Flow](./GitHub_Flow.md)
- Best For: Small to medium-sized projects requiring frequent deployments.
- Why: It’s simple, with minimal branch overhead, ideal for projects with continuous delivery directly to production.
- Limitations: Doesn’t handle multiple environments well, so it may not suit applications requiring staged environments for testing.
### 3. [GitLab Flow](./GitLab_Flow.md)
- Best For: Medium to large projects needing multiple environments (development, UAT, production).
- Why: Combines the simplicity of GitHub Flow with environment support, offering flexibility and easy progression through environments.
- Limitations: Can become complex with multiple branches for different environments, requiring careful tracking.
### 4. [Trunk-Based Development](./Trunk_Based_Development.md)
- Best For: Fast-paced projects with continuous integration and small teams.
- Why: Encourages short-lived branches and rapid integration, fitting well in CI/CD environments with automated testing.
- Limitations: Needs robust CI/CD tooling and a high degree of test automation, as the frequent integration could lead to instability without it.
### 5. [Release Flow](./Release_Flow.md)
- Best For: Stable applications where changes are released in organized, planned releases.
- Why: By isolating release branches, it ensures stability in production while allowing new features to develop in parallel.
- Limitations: Not ideal for teams needing to push frequent, unplanned updates or for projects that must react quickly to new requirements.

| **Release Flow**         | Enterprise, stable applications with controlled releases | Clear release isolation, robust for production apps  | Higher branch maintenance                          |
