# Release Flow Branching Strategy

### Overview
- **Purpose**: Similar to Git Flow but focuses on isolating release branches for final testing.
- **When to Use**: Suitable for projects with planned releases.

### Workflow Steps
1. **Develop Features in a Dedicated Branch** (e.g., `development`).
2. **Create a Release Branch** for final testing.
3. **Merge Release Branch into `production`** after validation.

### Git CLI Commands
- **Create a Feature Branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout development
  git pull origin development
  git checkout -b feature/feature-name
  ```
- **Create a Release Branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout development
  git checkout -b release/1.0.0
  git push origin release/1.0.0
  ```
- **Merge Release Branch into `production`**:
  ```bash
  git checkout production
  git merge release/1.0.0
  git push origin production
  ```

### Pros and Cons
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Isolates release for final testing | High branch maintenance required |
| Clear process for planned releases | Limited flexibility for rapid feature integration |
| Suitable for stable, enterprise applications | Not as agile for fast-moving projects |
