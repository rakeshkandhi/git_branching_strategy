# Git Flow Branching Strategy

### Overview
- **Purpose**: Git Flow is a structured branching strategy with clear workflows for feature development, testing, and releases.
- **When to Use**: Ideal for projects with regular release cycles, such as large or medium-sized applications with multiple releases over time.

### Workflow Steps
1. **Create Feature Branches** from `develop` for new features.
2. **Integrate Feature Branches into `develop`** after code review and testing.
3. **Create a Release Branch** when preparing for a release.
4. **Move the Release Branch to `main` (or `production`)** after final testing.
5. **Use Hotfix Branches** to fix urgent issues in `production` without disrupting `develop`.

### Git CLI Commands
- **Create a Feature Branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout develop
  git pull origin develop
  git checkout -b feature/feature-name
  ```
- **Merge Feature into `develop`**:
  ```bash
  git checkout develop
  git merge feature/feature-name
  git push origin develop
  ```
- **Create a Release Branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout develop
  git checkout -b release/1.0.0
  ```
- **Merge Release Branch into `main` (production)**:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge release/1.0.0
  git push origin main
  ```

### Pros and Cons
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Provides a structured release cycle | Complex with multiple branches |
| Clear separation of development and production | Higher maintenance with many branches |
| Supports hotfixes independently of features | Requires strong coordination |
